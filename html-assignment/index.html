I love to read, my favourite genre of books are romance and mystery. My favourite thing to do is to play video games and stream on twitch. one day I wish to be as good as RanbooLive at streaming. He is the <abbr title= "Greatest of all time">GOAT</abbr>. I like all kinds of music, I mostly like making music. I play all kinds of different musical instruments, I play the drums, guitar, bass, ukulele, flute, xylophone, piano, and I like to sing although I am not good at it. I don't have many dislikes but Some of them are spiders, Big crowds of people, and public speaking.
